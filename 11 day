Write a program that reads an integer N and prints the name of the polygon based on the number of sides N.

N=int(input())
if(N>2):
    if(N==3):
        print("Triangle")
    elif(N==4):
        print("Quadrilateral")
    elif(N==5):
        print("Pentagon")
    else:
        print("Big Polygon")
else:
    print("Not Polygon")

Write a program that reads an integer N and checks its divisibility by 5 and 10.

If N is divisible by 10, print Divisible by 10.
Else if N is divisible by 5 but not divisible by 10, print Divisible by 5.
Else, print Not Divisible by 10 or 5.

N=int(input())
if(N%10==0):
    print("Divisible by 10")
elif(N%5==0):
    print("Divisible by 5")
else:
    print("Not Divisible by 10 or 5")
