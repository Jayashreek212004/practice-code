Write a program that reads a string S and checks whether either of the following conditions is satisfied:

The length of S is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), OR

The first character of S is not equal to 'a'.

If at least one of the above conditions is true, print Valid String.
Otherwise, print Not a Valid String.

S=input()
l1=len(S)
R=l1>2 and l1<7
C=S[0]!='a'
if(R or C):
    print("Valid String")
else:
    print("Not a Valid String")
