Write a program that reads two numbers A and B and checks whether both the sum and the product of the given numbers have less than three digits.

A=input()
B=input()
R=str(int(A)+int(B))
J=str(int(A)*int(B))
L1=len(R)
L2=len(J)
print(L1<3 and L2<3)

Write a program that reads a three-digit number and checks if
the given number contains 0.
A=input()
print(A[0]=="0" or A[1]=="0" or A[2]=="0")

Write a program that reads a four-digit number and checks if
the first two digits of the number is 19 and the last two digits of
the number is between 30 and 60.
A=input()
print(A[:2]=="19" and int(A[2:])>30 and int(A[2:])<60)
